As an archaeologist, Professor Graham's approach to the subject matter has allowed me to see the development of the internet as not just a linear progression of technological advancements but as a constantly evolving landscape shaped by many different actors and influences.</p> <p>One of the most powerful things I've learned throughout this course is the imporatance of making good notes. The concept of using the memex trhoughout this course helped me keep track of a repository of my thoughts, ideas and connections. This memex allowed me to actively engage with the course content and make connections between different aspects of internet history. I also was able to explore new sources which allowed me to focus a bit more on my interest in AI, I really appreciated this level of freedom and it made for a really enjoyable class.</p> <p>By using my memex, I've come to appreicate the value of documenting everything and making connections between seemingly distinct ideas. I learned to be deliberate and thoughtful in my note-taking, prioritizing taking good, short  notes rather than long winded ones. Building from these short notes I created many thoughts that provided linkages between different ideas.</p> <p>I also found it very valuble to have access to other student's memexes, learning and even building upon their ideas.</p> <p>I truly realized the value of the memex when I formed a connection between two seemingly unrealted topics: the Green Revolution and its impact of food security, and Dewey's decimal system. This connection is  a prime example of how the memx allows for the synthesis of ideas accross diciplines and subject areas.

From there, we move to a note on Teaching and Technology which delves into the evolving role of technology in the classroom. Using Lisa Gitelmen's discussion on Media, we find a  connection to the implact of social media on education. Through this we find a linkage Alone together - NEW which discusses social media and it's impact on connection, but also the issues it raises. This brings us to Online Learning - NEW, an exploration on the new and changing learning environment which is later discussed in Innovations - NEW.</p> <p>Throughout this journey, the memex has proven valuble in creating connections between ideas.

This brings us  a step into the future with Online Learning - NEW. This note provides valuble insights into the ways technology has transformed education and created new opportuniies for remote learning. We then explore social media and it's impact on education. From there, the journey led to Teaching and Technology which further emphasized the importance of empracing technology in education, not resisting its potential to revolutinize the way we learn. This thought explores the potential of AI in teaching, using LLM as a means to teach students. This journey culminates with the note AI is Deep which reflects on the rapidly advancing field of AI and its potential to shape the future in many different fields.</p> <p>Reflecting on this journey, I believe that my desire to learn more about the internet to provide a scope into the future has been largely accomplished. I have gained a deeper understanding of the internet's origins, its impact on society and education, and the role of AI in shaping the future of technology.</p> <p>It is important to recognize that predicting the future of technology is an ongoing and extreamly complicated goal. As new innovations and developments continue to emerge, our understanding of the digital landsacpe must adapt accordingly. This journey has provided a solid foundation for engaging with these future developments in regards to education, but it's essential to continue learning and exploring to stay informed on the ever expanding world of tech.</p>"},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/#computers","title":"Computers","text":""},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/#technology","title":"technology","text":""},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/#ai","title":"AI","text":""},{"location":"Notes/Alone%20together%20-%20NEW/","title":"Alone together   NEW","text":"<p>Title: Alone together: Why we expect more from technology and less from each other date: 2023-04-12 type: permanent project:</p> <p>tags:: #socialmedia #communication #technology</p>"},{"location":"Notes/Alone%20together%20-%20NEW/#citation","title":"Citation","text":"<p>Turkle, S.
