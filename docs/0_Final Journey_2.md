At the beginning of this course I set out to gain a deeper understanding of the internet and its complex history,
with the goal of trying to predict the future of technology. A journey from the past to the present 
is explored below.

## The Journey Between docs/Notes/Turing Machine - NEW and docs/Thoughts/AI is Deep

[[AI is Deep]] is a note that explores the complexity of AI, as well as the possible futures fields we may 
explore. 

This journey begins with the foundational idea of the Turing Machine, which serves as a starting point for
understanding the development of computers and their roles in shaping the internet. This brings us 
a step into the future with [[Online Learning - NEW]]. This note provides valuble insights into the ways
technology has transformed education and created new opportuniies for remote learning. We then explore
social media and it's impact on education. From there, the journey led to [[Teaching and Technology]] which further
emphasized the importance of empracing technology in education, not resisting its potential to revolutinize the way we learn.
This thought explores the potential of AI in teaching, using LLM as a means to teach students. This journey
culminates with the note [[AI is Deep]] which reflects on the rapidly advancing field of AI and its potential to shape the future
in many different fields.

Reflecting on this journey, I believe that my desire to learn more about the internet to provide a scope into the future
has been largely accomplished. I have gained a deeper understanding of the internet's origins, its impact on
society and education, and the role of AI in shaping the future of technology.

It is important to recognize that predicting the future of technology is an ongoing and extreamly complicated goal.
As new innovations and developments continue to emerge, our understanding of the digital landsacpe must adapt accordingly.
This journey has provided a solid foundation for engaging with these future developments in regards to education, but
it's essential to continue learning and exploring to stay informed on the ever expanding world of tech.
