Although I have gained a foundational understanding of AI, the depth and complexity of this field is not to be underestimated. 
AI is comprised of many subfields, each with its own unique concepts and methodologies. These subfields include machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and more (as shown in [[Anatomy of an AI system]]). To truly understand the anatomy of AI, one must delve into the mathematical and statistical foundations that underlie machine learning algorithms, and the various techniques and approaches used to train and optimize these algorithms.
