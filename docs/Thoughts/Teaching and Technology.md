In the same way that Lisa Gitelman oulines that teaching has changed with technology from blackboard to slides, how might AI affect this teaching?

AI could drastically change teaching by making it more interactive and personalized. For example, AI could be used to create adaptive learning experiences that can adjust to the individual student's needs. AI could also be used to generate personalized activities and assignments that are tailored to the student's individual learning style. AI could also be used to provide real-time feedback and assessment so that teachers can adjust their instruction in order to better meet the student's needs.
