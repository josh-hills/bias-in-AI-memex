 Professor Graham discussed Cryptology and the importance of patterns in deciphering encoded messages, which reminded me of Dewey's development of a numerical classification system as opposed to alphabetical or subject-based systems. We can also draw a parallel from this to AI, which relies on patterns to make decisions. [[The Amherst Method The Origins of the Dewey Decimal Classification Scheme, Wiegand]]
