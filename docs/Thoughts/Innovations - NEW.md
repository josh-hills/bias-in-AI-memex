[[Online Learning - NEW]]
Thought for Online Learning and the Future of Education:
The shift to online learning can be likened to the development of the Turing Machine, as both innovations marked significant changes in their respective fields. The Turing Machine laid the groundwork for modern computers, which in turn have enabled the rise of online learning. The transition to online education has also revealed new possibilities and challenges, just as the Turing Machine exposed the potential and limitations of computation.
