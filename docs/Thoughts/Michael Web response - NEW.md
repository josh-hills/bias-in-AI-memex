Thank you Michael for providing such an interesting thought [[https://themike92.github.io/memex-HIST1900/Thoughts/Web/The%20Web%20became%20something%20unexpected/]]

I think this is a great analysis of the web's impacts, to build some more points toward this:

The World Wide Web has undergone a tremendous transformation since its inception. Initially conceived as a tool for information retrieval, it has morphed into an intricate network that has fundamentally changed our lives, in ways that were never anticipated by its creators.

Some key areas where the web has had a profound impact include:

   - Communication: The web has revolutionized the way we communicate, making it possible to instantly connect with people across the globe. Platforms like social media, email, and instant messaging have made it easier than ever to maintain relationships, collaborate, and share information.

   - Commerce: Online shopping and digital payment platforms have transformed the way we buy and sell products and services. The web has enabled the rise of e-commerce giants, such as Amazon and eBay, while also providing a platform for small businesses to reach a global audience.

   - Entertainment: The web has altered the entertainment landscape, with platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Spotify offering a wealth of content that is accessible anytime, anywhere. This shift has led to the decline of traditional media, such as print newspapers, and the rise of digital media.

   - Education: The web has opened up new avenues for learning, with countless resources available for free or at a minimal cost. Online courses, webinars, and educational platforms like Khan Academy and Coursera have democratized access to education, making it possible for people to learn at their own pace and on their own terms.

   - Work and collaboration: The web has made remote work and collaboration more feasible than ever before. Online platforms and tools, such as Google Docs and Zoom, have made it possible for teams to work together effectively, even when physically separated.

The web's evolution has far exceeded its original purpose, becoming an indispensable part of our daily lives. As technology continues to advance, the web will undoubtedly continue to evolve, presenting both new opportunities and challenges for society.
