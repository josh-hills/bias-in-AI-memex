[[Green Revolution - NEW]]
Thought for The Green Revolution and its Impact on Food Security:
The Green Revolution's impact on food security can be compared to Dewey's development of a numerical classification system as opposed to alphabetical or subject-based systems. Just as Dewey's system revolutionized the organization of information, the Green Revolution transformed agriculture, leading to significant improvements in crop yields and food security. However, both innovations also had unintended consequences, such as the marginalization of small-scale farmers in the case of the Green Revolution, and the potential for oversimplification and loss of context in Dewey's system.
