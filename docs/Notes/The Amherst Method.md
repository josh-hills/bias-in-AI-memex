### Introduction
- Covers the history of the Dewey Decimal, why?
	- There is much debate of its efficacy 
- We will better understand Melvil Dewey's thinking 
	- Which by doing so we understand the contextual forces that influenced his decisions

- Had a euerka moment,
	- To get absolute simplicity by breaking it down to numerals as decimals
	- Supplemented by the next simplest symbols (abc)
Despite the genius of his quote, it provided no origin where historians enter
### Conclusion
- Dewey calls his own Classification system the "Amherst method" which didn't stick
- The most important ideas that he pulled from are
1. the St. Louis Public School Library classification system and
2. Amherst College
- Utilizing the classification systems from these two locations, through his genius he established a simple and easy to adopt system that
	- helps people from anywhere understand a globalized system
