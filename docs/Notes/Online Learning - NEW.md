### Summary:
Online learning has transformed the way people access and experience education. It has made it possible for students to learn from a variety of sources, regardless of their location or socioeconomic status. However, online learning also presents challenges, such as a lack of interpersonal interaction, difficulty in assessing student engagement, and potential disparities in access to technology.
