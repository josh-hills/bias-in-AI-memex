- In April 1855, the current issue of 'Cosmos' magazine reported interest in creating Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. 
- The author of the article, L.F. Menabrea, was detained in Turin with Babbage, who explained the concept of the Analytical Engine to him. 
- Menabrea published a paper on the Engine in 1842 and a translation of it, accompanied by notes from Lady Ada Lovelace, was published in 1843. 
- Menabrea writes the letter to bring attention to Lovelace's work and explain the purpose and power of the Analytical Engine, which is capable of performing analytical and numerical operations like a Jacquard loom with perforated cards.
