### Summary:
The Green Revolution was a period of rapid agricultural innovation and productivity growth that occurred during the mid-20th century. It involved the development of high-yielding crop varieties, improved irrigation systems, and the widespread adoption of modern farming practices. While the Green Revolution helped to alleviate food shortages and improve food security in many parts of the world, it also led to environmental degradation and the marginalization of small-scale farmers.
