- Coded Bias is a 2020 documentary that explores the hidden biases embedded in AI systems and their implications on people's lives
- The film follows MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwini as she demonstrates the difficulty of AI facial recognition with dark-skinned faces, and features interviews with Harvard-connected researchers, including Zeynep Tufekci, Amy Webb, Cathy O'Neil, and Meredith Broussard. 
- Broussard is a data journalist and software developer who has written about how technology is misused and how "technochauvinism" has warped people's relationship to computers and each other. 
- She is also researching how AI intersects with race, gender, and ability in areas such as policing and cancer diagnosis
- Building a more diverse pipeline to tech careers is essential to fixing AI's flaws, yet women and people of color remain underrepresented in the field
