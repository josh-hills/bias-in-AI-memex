Throughout the history of the internet course, I've gained a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between
power, technology, people and culture. As an archaeologist, Professor Graham's approach to the subject
matter has allowed me to see the development of the internet as not just a linear progression of
technological advancements but as a constantly evolving landscape shaped by many different actors and influences.


One of the most powerful things I've learned throughout this course is the imporatance of making good notes.
The concept of using the memex trhoughout this course helped me keep track of a repository of my thoughts,
ideas and connections. This memex allowed me to actively engage with the course content and make connections
between different aspects of internet history. I also was able to explore new sources which allowed me to focus
a bit more on my interest in AI, I really appreciated this level of freedom and it made for a really enjoyable class.

By using my memex, I've come to appreicate the value of documenting everything and making connections between
seemingly distinct ideas. I learned to be deliberate and thoughtful in my note-taking, prioritizing taking good, short 
notes rather than long winded ones. Building from these short notes I created many thoughts that provided linkages
between different ideas.

I also found it very valuble to have access to other student's memexes, learning and even building upon their ideas.

I truly realized the value of the memex when I formed a connection between two seemingly unrealted topics:
the Green Revolution and its impact of food security, and Dewey's decimal system. This connection is 
a prime example of how the memx allows for the synthesis of ideas accross diciplines and subject areas.

The journey between the notes on "Bias in AI" and "Innovations" has been an enlightening and thought-provoking experience that demonstrates the power of the memex in connecting seemingly disparate ideas and topics.

Staring with [[Bias in AI]], we explored the implications of AI systems and their potential for biases to be deeply seeded within them,
even without the knowledge or intention from the programmer. From there, we move to a note on [[Teaching and Technology]]
which delves into the evolving role of technology in the classroom. Using Lisa Gitelmen's discussion on Media, we find a 
connection to the implact of social media on education. Through this we find a linkage [[Alone together - NEW]] which discusses
social media and it's impact on connection, but also the issues it raises. This brings us to [[Online Learning - NEW]],
an exploration on the new and changing learning environment which is later discussed in [[Innovations - NEW]].

Throughout this journey, the memex has proven valuble in creating connections between ideas. This allows us to have a deeper understanding 
of the topics, finding relationships where they're unexpeted.
